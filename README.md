# ShortSleep_support
## Abstract
This app is designed for short-term sleep and wakes the user up just before they enter deep sleep. It utilizes the heart rate data from the Apple Watch to estimate the user's sleep stage and determines the optimal time to wake the user based on the transitions between different sleep stages.    
This app based on a countdown timer app, it collects the user's heart rate data while counting down and simultaneously estimates the user's sleep stage at that time.
